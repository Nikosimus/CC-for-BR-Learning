## Organization of the code

- utils.py constains useful tools for saving results and making plots
- functions.py contains implementation of oracles and compression/quantization operators that we use
- Experiments.ipynb is a notebook for generating the plots from the paper
- Other .py files contain the implementation of corresponding methods
